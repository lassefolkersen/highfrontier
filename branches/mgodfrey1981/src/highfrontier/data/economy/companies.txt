explanation	None	None	Value of bitterness above which the company will raise the wages for a base	Modifier to how much the company is likely to bid for other firms	Determines how much each company is interested in doing research. Used to determine likelihood of starting up research companies.	The frame of time that is considered when predicting the future demand in calculate_demand_reaction_01 and calculate_demand_reaction_02	Used in calculate_supply_reaction_01 to determine a general pricing level	Tendency to focus on earlier transaction prices, as compared to more recent. Used in calculate_supply_reaction_01 to determine how much weight the pricing function should look give older transaction, when setting prices	Tendency to stockpile goods before selling. Used in calculate_supply_reaction_02 to determine the amount of stock to build up	Used in calculate_supply_reaction_02 to determine how fast the price is rising in response to demand (or something)	Used in evaluate_market_01 to determine how fast the company should be to start up a new firm. It is translated into the ratio of buy_offers to sell_offers at which a new firm will be started.	Used in evaluate_market_01 . It affects the decision of the scaling factor of the size of a new-started firm. If 100 it will match the output to the quantity currently sought on the market	The likelihood of starting up a merchant firm. Higher means more likely.
