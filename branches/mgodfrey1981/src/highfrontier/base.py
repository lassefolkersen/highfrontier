	The class that holds all methods of the bases
	A base is a city or similar gathering of people on a planet. It has one owner, which is a company (on earth the countries are "companies")
	Algorithms exists that will calculate the demand of the people in the base. This is done in a sims-like fashion where different
	demand-types need to be fulfilled. It is done a little more advanced though, since for example lack of food will make the food demand
	soar much more than lack of consumer goods for example. See relevant function for details.
	
	The owner of the base decide what he wants to "pour" into the demand of the people. This is done by setting the wage for the base
	
	An owner can thus decide the "life-quality" level of the population. The benefits and penalties for doing this to the extreme should
	be as follows:
		starvation
		emigration
		low research
	FIXME This should be implemented later

	def calculate_demand_reaction(self):
		"""
		The calculation of the demand of a base is special because it is more elastic than the demand of firms. Simply put the idea
		is that you give the workers a wage (which is saved as self.wages for each base), and then THEY decide how they spend the money
		given their various demand as humans.
		
		Explained a little more each resource of interest to a population has a demand curve defined. A demand curve is a function of 
		the current stock of the resource. It is given as (a, b, c) where the function then is:
		
			y = c * ((x / self.population)^a + b)
				a must be below or equal to zero, b must be above or equal to zero, c must be above zero
				
		in the trade resources.txt where the values are specified a, b and c are known as
		a: base_demand_elasticity 
		b: base_demand_asymptote
		c: base_demand_intensity
		
		This explains what they do somewhat, but in other words: 
			The more negative a is, the steeper the demand increases when the resource is gone (ie. food etc)
			The more positive b is, the more constant is the demand, even though it is getting fulfilled (ie. education is always needed and more is better)
			The more positive c is, the more demand there generally is for this resource (ie. health care should not be higher in demand than food, even though they share the same profile)
			The "tipping" point for where "low-a" goods become flat is around self.population. One unit per population can therefore be thought of as a "pretty content" place. But of course content-ness is relative, so don't get stuck on it.
		
		An R function to plot the curves, just in case
			a<--0.5
			b<-0.5
			c<-1
			population = 10
			x = seq(0.00001 * population,population*2,population/1000)
			plot(x,((x/population)^a+b)*c)
		
		The function returns a dictionary with each of the resources of interest as keys, and a numerical of demand as value.
		
		Resources are then bought by the demands calculated. The quantity wanted is always 1 per person, but the price is in relation
		to the demand value. If all demand is for food, then the food price is set to the entire value of the wage per person. If even 
		demand is for food and housing, then the wage is only split between these two.
		
		The elasticity comes from the fact that the input_output_dict also changes with the demand. This is to reflect the fact
		that virtually no consumption of education exists if you are starving etc. (Maslow's theories if you will, but more mixed. You can
		both want housing and self realization - you just want one more). The input_output_dict is changed so that food demand is
		always 1 per person, but all other units are set by their ratio with food. If food demands are sufficently met, this can lead
		to very much higher demands for consumer goods etc.
