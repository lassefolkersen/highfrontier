	self.vertex_dict and self.edge_dict
	The self.vertex_dict is a dictionary of dictionaries, each key being the technology_name variable of the tech. The dictionary
	that is its value contains the following:
		cartesian_coordinates		the coordinates of the tech in cartesian coordinates
		polar_coordinates			the coordinates of the tech in polar coordinates (these two are calculated at the beginning and should not be changed)
		known_by					Dictionary of companies (names as keys) that know this tech. Can also be "everybody" in which case everybody, including newly started companies gets to know it.
		technology_name				The name of the technology. This is also the key by which it is called
		neighbours					list with links to the connected technologies.
		for_sale_by					Dictionary of with companies as keys and the price they sell at as values
