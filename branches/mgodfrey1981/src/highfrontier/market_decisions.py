    the functions themselves will be shipped somewhere else, and so the market_decisions class is not used
    as a conventional .self.
    
    Yes it is quite possible that it would have been easier to put the function under firm and company classes
    respectively but I think this keeps it cleaner, when the "variable" parts are apart.
