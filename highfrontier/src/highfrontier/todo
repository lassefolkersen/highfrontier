
Consider speed advantages to drawing water (and waste) on top of the sphereform instead of the planar form
Fix the mining system, right not it does not consume anything to mine
Make a climate model that "checks" a planet say every year and updates for example the temperature, and the loss of gases
The distance calculation needs checking. Glasgow to Kisangini (middle of africa) has been observed to be closer than other european cities
expand the implode_and_expand function so that it can be used, on already existing technology. This probably involves adding options for including input_output_dicts in the "common knowledge"
It would be nice that the planet view automatically zoomed on a city after zooming out from this (actually this might be complicated)
Realitify the variables - find out how large the fossil fuel consumption per capita is, how much energy is produced per fuel. Total energy consumption etc.
Slight speed advantage can be gained by selectively updating the base_position and areas_of_interest dicts selectively when building a new base
AI does not know about mining opportunities at present
